# Blog Assignment

This is my take on the final assignment in the course web servers and databases!

This task is intended to enhance the understanding of full-stack web development, focusing on aspects like database interaction, authentication, and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It tackles managing relational data, structuring and querying a PostgreSQL database, and handling user authentication.
